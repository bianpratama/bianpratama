A young man who got passion in the world of arts and culture, sharing ideas to others, and playing basketball in his spare time. Currently seeking chance to deal with his dreams and ambitions.

He is from Indonesia, a country where art/design work is less appreciated. A self-taught artist wannabe who learnt art and design since the day he was brought into junior high school. Got a hiatus of doing art-related things, when he went to semi-military senior high school (Taruna Nusantara Senior High School).

Now, get along his accounting major in Gadjah Mada University, while keep his passion for art alive. Over the years, he has created numerous number of logos, posters, events’ design, and personal projects of himself. Bian often works various parts of the process himself. From making the early sketch, illustrating, editing, till building the whole set. He likes to get a better understanding of the trade.

Started Local Tobacco in December 2011 — a digital creative agency, to be one of the medium he uses to unleash his thirstiness of creativity. Later, his passion for art/design is mingling with a love affair to product design & production. Thus, he started OAK Merchandise with his four comrades, in November 2012 — a production house for merchandise. Then followed by starting Local Living in September 2013 — a furniture and appliance product brand.

His romance story with creativity will continuously evolve at every turn with limitless possibilities. He is hungry, and he had already found what he loves. He will take risks, do something that has not been done before, and make it worth all the effort and thoughts for things that he loves.

One of his beliefs, quoted from the farewell message placed on the back cover of the 1974 edition of The Whole Earth Catalog: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish”.
